# Image-Classification-using-CNN
In this project we are going to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset using tensorflow. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. You'll preprocess the images, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. The images need to be normalized and the labels need to be one-hot encoded. This project was done as a part of Soft Computing course.
